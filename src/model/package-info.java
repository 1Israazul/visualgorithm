/**
 * This package contains the model of the software. It is composed by different
 * data structures that are open in the software. Each of these data structures
 * takes part of a data structure model. A model must implement the interface
 * <tt>IModel</tt> directly or through a more specific interface. Thus, a new
 * data structure must implement <tt>IDataStructure</tt> to define a type. It
 * must also take part of a data structure model at the name of the data
 * structure that implement <tt>IDataStructureModel</tt> or a more specific
 * interface.
