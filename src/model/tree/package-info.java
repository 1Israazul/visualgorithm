/**
 * This package contains one part of the data structure model of the software :
 * trees. Currently, only binary trees have been implemented but the creation of
 * other trees is possible. The current implementation of binary trees is
 * quite simple and it is designed for inheritance in order to create other
 * types of binary trees. This package contains binary search trees, AVL trees
 * and red black trees. If you would like to create other trees, do not forget
 * to implement the interface IDataStructure from the parent package.
