 * This package contains the controllers of the software. A controller is,

 * to communicate with the model. It also manages the model and the view. This
 * package is composed by different data structure controllers that take part
 * of a software controller. There is a data structure controller for each data
 * structure in the software. All new data structure controllers must implement
 * <tt>IDataStructureController</tt> directly or through a more specific
 * interface.
