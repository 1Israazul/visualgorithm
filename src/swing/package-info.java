/**
 * This package contains the view of the software. It is composed by different
 * data structure views that are open in the software. Each of these data
 * structure views takes part of a tabbed pane. A view must implement the
 * interface <tt>IView</tt> directly or through a more specific interface. Thus
 * a new data structure view must take part of the software view at the name of
 * the data structure and implement <tt>IDataStructureView</tt> or a more
 * specific interface.
